# Auction Site

This is a Django-based auction site created as part of the CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course's [Projects](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/), that allows users to create and bid on auction listings, add items to a watchlist, and leave comments. The site supports user authentication and features an admin interface for managing listings, bids, and comments. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the frontend.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out. Different content is displayed depending on whether the user is signed in.
- **Create Listing**: Users can create new auction listings with a title, description, starting bid, optional image, and category.
- **Active Listings Page**: Displays all active auction listings, including title, description, current price, and image (if provided).
- **Listing Page**: Each listing has a dedicated page showing all details, including current bids, comments, and options to add to a watchlist, place a bid, or close the auction.
- **Watchlist**: Signed-in users can add listings to their watchlist and view all items in their watchlist on a dedicated page.
- **Bidding**: Users can place bids on active listings. The bid must be higher than the current bid and meet the starting bid criteria.

- **Auction Countdown Timer**: Display a live countdown timer on listing pages to indicate when the auction will end.
- **Buy Now Option**: Add a "Buy Now" feature that allows users to purchase an item immediately at a set price, bypassing the auction process.
- **Rating and Reviews**: Allow users to rate and review sellers after an auction is completed.
- **Social Sharing**: Add options to share listings on social media platforms to attract more bidders.
